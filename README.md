# üì± GSM-Based Home Automation Using Arduino  

## üöÄ Project Overview  
This project presents a **GSM-based Home Automation System** that allows users to remotely control home appliances using SMS commands. The system leverages the **Arduino Mega microcontroller**, **SIM900A GSM module**, and other components to enhance convenience and energy efficiency for home users.  

## ‚ú® Key Features  
- **Remote Control via SMS:** Users can turn appliances ON/OFF through SMS commands.  
- **Scheduling Timer:** Automate switching of appliances using RTC (Real-Time Clock) module.  
- **Mobile App Integration:** Developed with MIT App Inventor for a simple control interface.  
- **SMS Notifications:** Feedback messages indicate the status of appliances.  
- **Energy Efficiency:** Helps reduce energy wastage by remotely managing appliances.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functions  
- **Turn Appliance ON/OFF:**  
  - Send `"ON#<appliance_number>"` to switch an appliance ON.  
  - Send `"OFF#<appliance_number>"` to switch an appliance OFF.  
- **Scheduling Timer:**  
  - Set automatic ON/OFF schedules using the built-in RTC module and push button switches.  
- **Status Notifications:**  
  - Receive SMS updates with the current status of controlled appliances.  
- **Manual Control:**  
  - Operate appliances directly using a physical switchbox.

## üîß System Components  
- **Arduino Mega 2560**: The main microcontroller board.  
- **SIM900A GSM Module**: Handles SMS communication.  
- **RTC Module (DS3231)**: Provides scheduling capabilities.  
- **Relay Module (HL-54S)**: Manages appliance switching.  
- **16x04 LCD Module**: Displays appliance status.  

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Enhance system security to prevent unauthorized access.
- Add features like brightness control for lights and speed control for fans.
- Develop a more comprehensive utility mobile application.
