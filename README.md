# GSM Based Home Automation Using Arduino

This is my thesis project along with my partner, Pat and we utilized the following tools/applications: Arduino, Proteus, MITApp Inventor, GSM Module and many firmware modules (see the copy for full details). The primary function for this system is it can automatically switch on/off the applicances by sending an SMS from the device without much effort. 

In this repository, the .ino file is attached for the reference. Will update more of this content
